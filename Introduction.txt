What if there is a real-time distributed network that Monitor air quality on a street-by-street level using Python, Cloud and IoT ?

Nowadays, the air quality is considered a key point, and its accurate monitoring is not only suggested but it is even required in many areas.However, traditional standard monitors for air quality are very expensive and happens at a few stations that are few and far between. Since , the use of a low-cost distributed network of sensors represents a valid complementary approach.This got us thinking about how much the air quality could vary on a street-by-street level, and how to measure it.
What if we used cabs to collect air quality data across the city in near real-time? The great thing about cabs is that it has an abundance of cabs, and they go everywhere. On a larger scale (with even more cabs) we could even collect enough data to build pollution maps that let us better understand how pollution may affect some areas more than others.
In this project we'll be logging: longitude, latitude, temperature, humidity, pressure, and air borne particulate counts (PM10 - particles with a diameter between 2.5 µm and 10 µm, PM2.5 - fine particles with a diameter of 2.5 µm or less). 
Power to the device will be provided by a solar panel or an Battery. Using the data collect by the cabs or we say moving station point will be plotted to create a real-time analytics.This type of monitoring will also be cost effective as it will cost lesser then setup a whole weather station. Cabs Driver or aggregators can be easily convinced  to earn a little bit of extra money by putting these station points
